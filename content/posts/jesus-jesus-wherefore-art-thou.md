“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.””

— ‭‭Joshua‬ ‭1:9‬

Where o where can I go from you my Lord? Surely goodness and mercy shall reign down on me and my family? Life has its highs and it has its lows; during the storms wherefore art thou Lord? Why the seasons of silence? Why the longing and aching continues to weave and coarse through my veins? For it is in the silence, the small still silence that can be found if sought for during the times of calm that you will find me and then you will realise that I never left you, I never forsake you, I was always by your side and was always willing you on. For my love for you never diminishes nor does it fail to blossom in your life. 

Do not be blindsided by this world and all the entrapments that it has to offer. Enjoy your life, enjoy the richness and splendour of what your hands make but remember the source and most excellently remember the poor and hurting amongst you for their need is fulfilled through you. 

Believe in great things and you shall achieve them; believe in failure and you shall accomplish failure. A single thought is enough to change the world, a single action is enough to bring change to man, world and destiny. Choose your thoughts therefore wisely and remember to focus on the Lord your God for he is sovereign and rightly to be praised. He will lift you up on wings of eagles and make you soar like one in the heavens. Praise his name whilst you have breath and lift your hands to the heavens. Hallelujah for he is mighty and wonderful, his name is councillor and creator of all things under the stars and above. 

For we are here for a mere moment but his goodness lives beyond our insight and understanding. Don’t look unto what others have and become jealous but instead look to what you have and become zealous. Give to those around you without reprise, give to those in need and serve them with the goodness and integrity of your heart for the Lord loves a cheerful giver and obedient servant. Look how the sun rises and sets each day without fail, look how the rain falls to provide water to the ground to feed those that he loves. Where can man go from Him? For he is all around, he is in the wind, he is in the very breath that you breathe. 

Honour him with your first fruits and speak of his goodness with all in your family. Take time to be in his presence, to rest, to recuperate, to revel in his love. 

These are the words given to me this day Sunday 2nd February 2020. 

Enjoy life! Don’t bemoan what you don’t have, look to what you do have and make good on that. Praise him!
