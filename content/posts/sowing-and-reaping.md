“Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”

— ‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭9:6-7‬‬

If you sow a single handful of seeds then that is what you will reap! If you sow 200 handfuls of seeds then you will reap an abundance! It’s simple when you look at it like that. 

Let us remember this simple equation when giving our time, care, love, attention and money and remember that God loves a cheerful giver 😊
