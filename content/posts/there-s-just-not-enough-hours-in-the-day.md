## Verse

> ###### Exodus 18:17-18 (NIV)
>
> **17** Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good. **18** You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.

> Ask yourself this, are you achieving your capacity in all that you do or are you finding that there are not enough hours in each day that God gives you?

We would do well to heed this advice given to Moses. We don’t always have the caring father or mother in law but we do have a Heavenly Father who knows our plight only too well. We need moments of downtime to assess our “workload” to ascertain whether we are overloaded or not. Chances are we are doing too much and not paying attention to the important things.  
  
For instance, are you focusing nearly all your attention on your 9-5 job and paying little to no intention on those nearest and dearest around you? Ask yourself this, are you achieving your capacity in all that you do or are you finding that there are not enough hours in each day that God gives you? If your answer is the latter then watch out because trouble is looming under the surface and unless you pray for wisdom in how to better manage your time and responsibilities then ultimately disaster can and most likely will befall you.  
  
That’s the reality but thank goodness you’re not running this race alone; you have a saviour that’s got your back and wants to see you flourish in all the right ways for all the right reasons!  
  
So delegate your tasks to Him who is more than able to relieve you of your burdens and remember what it says in Matthew 11:28-30: -  
  
“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  
‭‭  
Amen.
