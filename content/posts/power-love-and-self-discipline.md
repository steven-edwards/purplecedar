“For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.”

— ‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭1:7

What Spirit is this? The Holy Spirit of God! 

This is not some second rated weak add-on to us! This is the immaculate Spirit of God, his will come to live in us and to make us mighty for his namesake. 

Therefore we have all that we need to succeed and flourish but don’t focus on me alone for failure and loneliness is sure to come knocking at your door. What good is it to own all the riches of this world but not have love and empathy for your neighbour. 

Give and serve just as Jesus demonstrated to us.
